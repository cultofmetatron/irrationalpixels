Previously, we created the initial Phoenix app and created a `Teacher` struct and table.
We went over how to perform the basic CRUD operations as well as how to do some basic tests to verify the functionality.
In part 2, we're going to be adding more structs and defining relationships between them.
We'll also go over how to fetch records with their associations.

If you haven't been following along, you can checkout the code from GitHub and fetch the branch:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:cultofmetatron/database-modeling-with-ecto-example.git
git checkout part1
```

## has many and belongs to

We now have a `Teacher` Ecto schema as an interface to our `teachers` table.
Lets implement a class.
A `Class` at most belongs to one `Teacher`.
The standard way to setup a relationship is through foreign keys.
That is a column that matches a column on another table, which must be unique on the other table.
The type of the foreign key column must match the type of the key on the foreign table that it's referencing.

We will create a column `teacher_id` on the `classes` table that will have a _foreign key constraint_ on the `id` columnn of the `teachers` table.
Since the `id` column of `teachers` is a uuid, the column here will also be a `uuid`.
Being the primary key of the table, it already satisfies the aformentioned uniqueness contraint.
In Ecto, we call it a `:binary_id`.

```zsh
$ mix phx.gen.schema Class classes name:string teacher_id:references:teachers subject:string active:boolean
* creating lib/grade_tracker/class.ex
* creating priv/repo/migrations/20210515195753_create_classes.exs

Remember to update your repository by running migrations:

    $ mix ecto.migrate

```

Now that we've created the associated class and migrations, we need to make some small adjustments.

First lets look at the migration:

```elixir
defmodule GradeTracker.Repo.Migrations.CreateClasses do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def change do
    create table(:classes, primary_key: false) do
      add :id, :binary_id, primary_key: true
      add :name, :string
      add :subject, :string
      add :active, :boolean, default: false, null: false
      add :teacher_id, references(:teachers, on_delete: :nothing, type: :binary_id)

      timestamps()
    end

    create index(:classes, [:teacher_id])
  end
end

```

Same as teacher, we have an id set with `:binary_id` which corresponds to the `UUID` type in Postgres.
Note that part for teacher id, we have an `on_delete: :nothing`.
Change that to

```elixir

add :teacher_id, references(:teachers, on_delete: :nilify_all, type: :binary_id)

```

The call to [_references/2_](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto_sql/Ecto.Migration.html#references/2) creates the foreign key constraint.
What this means is any non null values for the teacher_id column of this table **MUST** correspond to a a record in the `teachers` table in the referenced column.
This leads to some edge cases that must be accounted for.
What happens if the referenced teacher record is deleted?
All classes referring to that teacher would have values for `teacher_id` that violates the contraint.
If you have a few classes that belong to this teacher and you try to remove the teacher, you will get an error from the database.
This is rarely what I want.

The `on_delete` specifies the action to take place if the referenced record is deleted.
If we leave the value as `:nothing`, we will get the error I mentioned.
In this case, I am switching it to `:nilify_all`.
This makes the class without a teacher.
In a real world scenario, I could make a dashboard showing the orphaned classes prompting them to assign a teacher.
Alternativly, I could set `delete_all` which would remove the classes that reference the teacher.
What you pick for your relationships depends entirely on your use case.

By default, the key is set to `id`. You can overide that by passing in `:column`.
We can also add it to make the associated column more explicit.

If we wanted to make it so that all classes MUST have a teacher id passed in, you could pass `null: false` to the column creation.
If you do that, `nilify_all` will not work as it will violate the null column contraint.
You will have to either `delete_all` or have your app force the user to reassign the class before removing a teacher.

```elixir

# does the same thing as above
add :teacher_id, references(:teachers, on_delete: :nilify_all, type: :binary_id, column: :id)

```

One more thing, we should make that default for the `active` column to be true.

Your migration should look like this:

```elixir

defmodule GradeTracker.Repo.Migrations.CreateClasses do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def change do
    create table(:classes, primary_key: false) do
      add :id, :binary_id, primary_key: true
      add :name, :string
      add :subject, :string
      add :active, :boolean, default: true, null: false
      add :teacher_id, references(:teachers, on_delete: :delete_all, type: :binary_id)

      timestamps()
    end

    create index(:classes, [:teacher_id])
  end
end


```

Now let's take a look at the schema.

```elixir

defmodule GradeTracker.Class do
  use Ecto.Schema
  import Ecto.Changeset

  @primary_key {:id, :binary_id, autogenerate: true}
  @foreign_key_type :binary_id
  schema "classes" do
    field :active, :boolean, default: false
    field :name, :string
    field :subject, :string
    field :teacher_id, :binary_id

    timestamps()
  end

  @doc false
  def changeset(class, attrs) do
    class
    |> cast(attrs, [:name, :subject, :active])
    |> validate_required([:name, :subject, :active])
  end
end

```

By default, the schema specifies no relationship to Teacher.
We need to modify this schema by replaceing the `teacher_id` field with [_belongs_to/3_](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Schema.html#belongs_to/3).
it'll probably be a good idea to add a foreign constraint to the validation code in the changeset as well.
Additionally, we'll remove active as a required field since we have a default and add the `:teacher_id` as a castable attribute.

```elixir

defmodule GradeTracker.Class do
  use Ecto.Schema
  import Ecto.Changeset

  @primary_key {:id, :binary_id, autogenerate: true}
  @foreign_key_type :binary_id
  schema "classes" do
    field :active, :boolean, default: true
    field :name, :string
    field :subject, :string


    belongs_to :teacher, GradeTracker.Teacher

    timestamps()
  end

  @doc false
  def changeset(class, attrs) do
    class
    |> cast(attrs, [:name, :subject, :active, :teacher_id])
    |> validate_required([:name, :subject])
    |> foreign_key_constraint(:teacher_id)
  end
end


```

I will note that adding `:teacher_id` is optional and may not be appropriate for your use case.
The 'belongs to' adds other operations we will use to link classes to their associated teachers.
By adding the column directly, you allow the column to be set directly.
This means you should do due diligence when directly passing along user input;
for instance, you take params input from a web request and pass it directly in when creating a changeset.

Now we we add a [_has_many/3_](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Schema.html#has_many/3) to the Teacher.

```elixir

defmodule GradeTracker.Teacher do
  use Ecto.Schema
  import Ecto.Changeset

  @primary_key {:id, :binary_id, autogenerate: true}
  @foreign_key_type :binary_id
  schema "teachers" do
    field :name, :string

    has_many :classes,  GradeTracker.Class

    timestamps()
  end

  @doc false
  def changeset(teacher, attrs) do
    teacher
    |> cast(attrs, [:name])
    |> validate_required([:name])
  end
end

```

Now that we have everything setup in code, let's run the migrations.
Make sure you have the proper configuration setup in `config/dev.exs`.

```zsh
$ mix ecto.migrate                                                                               [2.7.1]

```

### Building Relations

Now that we have a has_many relationship setup between `Teacher`, we can start thinking about inserting classes.

First lets create a new test file `/test/grade_tracker_web/schemas/class_test.exs`

Since we are testing out connected associations, I've added a setup case that creates a `Teacher` struct that we can use for all our demonstrations

In our schema, a `Class` can be produced without a teacher, so we can insert one in exactly the same as we could with `Teacher`.

```elixir
defmodule GradeTracker.ClassSchemaTest do
  use  GradeTracker.DataCase
  alias GradeTracker.Repo
  alias GradeTracker.Teacher
  alias GradeTracker.Class


  def create_teacher(context) do
    teacher = %Teacher{}
    |> Teacher.changeset(%{
      name: "Jose Valim"
    })
    |> Repo.insert!()

    {:ok, %{ teacher: teacher }}
  end

  setup :create_teacher


  test "we can insert a class", %{ teacher: _teacher } do
    assert {:ok, _} = %Class{}
    |> Class.changeset(%{
      name: "botony 101",
      subject: "biology",
    })
    |> Repo.insert()

  end
end

```

Since we added `:teacher_id` to the list of castable attributes, we can pass it in directly.
Once it's set, we can load the associated item into the structure using [Repo.preload/3](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Repo.html#c:preload/3)

```elixir
defmodule GradeTracker.ClassSchemaTest do
    #...

  test "we can insert a teacher with a class by setting the column directly",  %{ teacher: teacher } do
    assert {:ok, class} = %Class{}
    |> Class.changeset(%{
      name: "botony 101",
      subject: "biology",
      teacher_id: teacher.id
    })
    |> Repo.insert()

    assert class.teacher_id == teacher.id
    class = class |> Repo.preload([:teacher])

    assert %Teacher{ name: "Jose Valim", id: teacher_id } = class.teacher
    assert teacher_id == teacher.id

  end

end

```

#### Ecto.build_assoc

Setting up a `has_many` in the schema provides a lot of information to Ecto for how to link up associated database structs.
The example above only works if you are directly casting a teacher_id.
In practice, you are more likely to use Ecto's [Ecto.build_assoc/3](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html#build_assoc/3) to create a new struct based on has_many relationships. You can pass this into your changeset function to create changesets with the association set.

```elixir
defmodule GradeTracker.ClassSchemaTest do
    #...

  test "we can insert a teacher with a class with build_assoc",  %{ teacher: teacher } do
    assert {:ok, class} = teacher
    |> Ecto.build_assoc(:classes) # we get it from the key you set in the schmema after has_many
    |> Class.changeset(%{
      name: "botony 101",
      subject: "biology"
    })
    |> Repo.insert()

    assert class.teacher_id == teacher.id
    class = class |> Repo.preload([:teacher])

    assert %Teacher{ name: "Jose Valim", id: teacher_id } = class.teacher
    assert teacher_id == teacher.id

  end

end

```

#### Ecto.Changeset.put_assoc

We can also build a `Teacher` from a `Class` but they wont be connected with an association.

This is because we aren't writing anything to the class which is where the column that sets the association is set.
We would have to set that explicitly using [Ecto.Changeset.put_assoc/4](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Changeset.html#put_assoc/4).

> Note: you will need to preload the association before you attempt to update the association.

```elixir

defmodule GradeTracker.ClassSchemaTest do
   #...

  test "we build a teacher from a class using build assoc as well",  %{ teacher: _teacher } do
    assert {:ok, class} = %Class{}
    |> Class.changeset(%{
      name: "botony 101",
      subject: "biology",
    })
    |> Repo.insert()

    assert {:ok, teacher } = class
    |> Ecto.build_assoc(:teacher)
    |> Teacher.changeset(%{
      name: "Richard Feynman"
    })
    |> Repo.insert()

    # the association has to be loaded before we can alter it; leave this out and you'll get an error
    class = class |> Repo.preload([:teacher])

    assert {:ok, class} = class
      |> Class.changeset(%{})
      |> Ecto.Changeset.put_assoc(:teacher, teacher)
      |> Repo.update()

    class = class |> Repo.preload([:teacher], force: true) #we force a refresh to get the new data

    assert class.teacher_id == teacher.id


    assert %Teacher{ name: "Richard Feynman", id: teacher_id } = class.teacher
    assert teacher_id == teacher.id

  end

end

```

And with that, you have the tools to construct relations based on has_many and belongs_to.
to wrap things up:

#### Key ideas

- A refernces id is used to set a record as belonging to another record.
- You can use **build_assoc** to create an associated record for insertion.
- **put_assoc** is used to set an association after the fact.

Next I'll go over how to create many to many relationships.
